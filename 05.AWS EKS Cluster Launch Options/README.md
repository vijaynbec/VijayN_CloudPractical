# 🚀 Methods to Launch an EKS Cluster in AWS  #

You can launch an EKS cluster using various approaches depending on your automation preferences, infrastructure stack, and AWS experience.



## 🧰 1. Using eksctl (Recommended for Quick Start)
CLI tool created by Weaveworks that provisions the cluster and nodegroups in one command.


## 🔧 2. Using EC2 with AWS Consol 
Launch EKS via the graphical interface and some CLI within AWS instance.


## 🛠 3. Using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
Automate EKS provisioning using declarative HCL templates and modules.



## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- AWS offers multiple methods to launch EKS clusters, each suited to different levels of automation and expertise.
- eksctl is ideal for quick starts and prototyping, offering a one-command cluster setup.
- Using EC2 with AWS Console provides hands-on control and is great for learning the underlying components.
- Terraform enables scalable, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure provisioning—perfect for production environments and team collaboration.
- Choosing the right method depends on your goals: speed, control, or automation.
