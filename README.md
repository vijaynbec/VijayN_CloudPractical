# 🚀 Vijay - Cloud Portfolio 
   <img src="./Banner.png" alt="Cloud Portfolio Banner" width="200x500"/>




Welcome to my curated portfolio of AWS infrastructure projects, built to demonstrate hands-on expertise in cloud architecture, DevOps automation, and data platform integration.

Each demo reflects production-grade patterns with Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration, secure networking designed to be modular, Databricks, Datalake, medalian pipeline and production ready patterns.


## 🌟 Highlights
- ✅ Scalable AWS architectures with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- 🔁 Automated CI/CD pipelines for EC2, Lambda, and container workloads
- 🐳 Kubernetes/EKS clusters deployed via eksctl, EC2 CLI, and Terraform
- 🧠 Enterprise networking demos: VPC peering, endpoints, flow logs, Transit Gateway
- 📊 Data platform integrations with Databricks Platform, Unity Catalog, Data pipelines
- 🔒 Security‑first design: IAM roles, encryption, private networking, monitoring
